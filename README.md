# Project Based Learning with React

This repository contains a collection of the projects I've built to facilitate learning React.

Within the /src/Components directory you will find a directory for each "App" within this project.
Each "App" component contains a "Components" directory where you will find the main React code for that app.

For Example, to view the code for the Weather App navigate to: [./src/Components/Weather/Components](./src/Components/Weather/Components)
